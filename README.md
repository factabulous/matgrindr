Introduction
====

MatGrindr is a plugin for EDMC that allows you to specify which 
materials you are looking for. It will then direct you to locations
for those materials and tell you what to do when you get there.

Prerequistes
----


You will need EDMC installed https://github.com/Marginal/EDMarketConnector/wiki

Installation
----

Unzip the plugin into EDMCs plugins directory. It appears as a plugin called
matgrindr - there is a settings page to set what you need, and the status should
show on the main EDMC page. 

Usage
----

In the settings page select the items you want. 

If you need to find a location on a planet it will
tell you the heading to get there once you enter planetary cruise - we recommend
setting EDMC to 'always on top' so you can see the heading.
