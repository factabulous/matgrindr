Introduction
====

MatGrindr is a plugin for EDMC that allows you to specify which 
materials you are looking for in Elite Dangerous. It will then direct you to locations
for those materials and tell you what to do when you get there.

It does this by using lists of locations drived from Canonn datasets.

At the moment it can guide you to Thargoid Sensors (at crash sites), Thargoid
Links (at Thargoid Structures) and various other raw materials at Brain Tree 
sites.

Prerequistes
----


You will need EDMC installed https://github.com/Marginal/EDMarketConnector/wiki

Installation
----

Unzip the plugin into EDMCs plugins directory. It appears as a plugin called
matgrindr-release - there is a settings page to set what you need, and the 
status should show on the main EDMC page. 

Usage
----

In the settings page select the items you want. 

If you need to find a location on a planet it will
tell you the heading to get there once you enter planetary cruise - it is
recommended to set EDMC to 'always on top' so you can see the heading.

The angle of descent is only shown once it is at least 30 degrees - it's recommended to start descent a bit later as if your angle becomes less than 30 degree it will switch off again.
