0.0.5 alpha
---

* Fixed issue with the version update notification code that could cause an EDMC crash
* Now always show descent angle when near a planet (used to only show above 30 degrees, now we trust users to choose the angle)
* Should be less likely to flip between targets on the same planet as you get near them
* Added ability to skip a location (the X icon), so if there are multiple locations on the same planet you don't have to visit them all before you can be told a new location
